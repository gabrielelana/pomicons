# What is that?
This is a font with 8 symbols to talk about the ["Pomodoro Technique"Â®](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)

# What do they mean?
* *CLEAN_CODE* at codepoint `u+E000` this has nothing to do with the pomodoro technique, but it's nice to have a symbol for something that is so important :-)
* *POMODORO_DONE* at codepoint `u+E001` symbolize a pomodoro that was done in the paste, should be used to say something like _"today I have done 12 `u+E001`"_
* *POMODORO_ESTIMATED* at codepoint `u+E002` symbolize a pomodoro estimated/allocated for an activity in the future
* *POMODORO_TICKING* at codepoint `u+E003` symbolize the current timer, should be used to tell how long it takes to the end of the current pomodoro
* *POMODORO_SQUASHED* at codepoint `u+E004` symbolize a pomodoro interrupted, not finished and so not worth it aka wasted time
* *LONG_PAUSE* at codepoint `u+E005` means that have passed more than 10 minutes since the last pomodoro ended
* *AWAY* at codepoint `u+E006` means that have passed more than 50 minutes since the last pomodoro ended
* *PAIR_PROGRAMMING* at codepoint `u+E007` means that you are doing the current pomodoro in pair programming with someone else

Note that I don't have a symbol for a short pause (less than 10 minutes since the last pomodoro ended) because the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) already contains the perfect symbol [coffe](http://fontawesome.io/icon/coffee)
