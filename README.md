# What is that?
This is a font with 8 symbols to talk about the ["Pomodoro Technique"®](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)


# Why?
I use the ["Pomodoro Technique"®](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) a lot and I've done that for many years, I'm a computer programmer, I make my own tools to keep track of my pomodori and I've always wanted some icons to indicate high level concepts in a terse and aesthetically pleasing way. For me symbol fonts are perfect because they could be used everywhere, even in a `VT100` terminal [see](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts)


# What Do They Mean?
* **CLEAN_CODE** at codepoint `u+E000` this has nothing to do with the pomodoro technique, but it's nice to have a symbol for something that is so important :-)
* **POMODORO_DONE** at codepoint `u+E001` symbolize a pomodoro that was done in the paste, should be used to say something like _"today I have done 12 `u+E001`"_
* **POMODORO_ESTIMATED** at codepoint `u+E002` symbolize a pomodoro estimated/allocated for an activity in the future
* **POMODORO_TICKING** at codepoint `u+E003` symbolize the current timer, should be used to tell how long it takes to the end of the current pomodoro
* **POMODORO_SQUASHED** at codepoint `u+E004` symbolize a pomodoro interrupted, not finished and so not worth it aka wasted time
* **SHORT_PAUSE** at codepoint `u+E005` means that have passed less than 10 minutes since the last pomodoro ended
* **LONG_PAUSE** at codepoint `u+E006` means that have passed more than 10 minutes since the last pomodoro ended
* **AWAY** at codepoint `u+E007` means that have passed more than 50 minutes since the last pomodoro ended
* **PAIR_PROGRAMMING** at codepoint `u+E008` means that you are doing the current pomodoro in pair programming with someone else
* **INTERNAL_INTERRUPTION** at codepoint `u+E009` means that an interruption occurred and you are the source (ex. You remembered to do something or feel an urge to do something)
* **EXTERNAL_INTERRUPTION** at codepoint `u+E00A` means that you have been interrupted by others (ex. Someone else asked you a question or a notification came up)
